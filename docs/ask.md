# How to ask a good question

Asking good questions is **the best way to get good answers**. Try to follow these tips:

* Make the question precise and specific. *"My code doesn't work"*, for example, does not help us to help you as much as *"This following code me an answer I didn't expect"*.
* Show that you've **tried to solve the problem yourself**. Everyone who answers questions on the list has a full-time job or study to do; no-one gets paid for answering these support questions. Spend their goodwill wisely: *"Here's the code I tried..."* or *"I read in the documentation that ..."* shows that you've at least made some effort to find things out for yourself.
* Where appropriate **show a complete test case**. Seeing where your code goes wrong is generally much easier if we can run it our our computers. Corollaries: don't post your entire project - take some time to reduce it down to a minimal test case. **Include enough data** - runnable code is no help if critical resources. Reducing your code down to a minimal test case is often enough for you to figure out the problem yourself, which is always satisfying!
* **Don't re-post your question after only a few hours**. People are busy, and may be in a different timezone to you. If you're not sure if your question made it to the list, look in the archive.
* **Adding lots of exclamation marks or other punctuation** will **not** move your question up the queue. Quite the reverse, in fact.
* Ask questions **on the list, rather than emailing the developers directly**. This gives us the chance to share the load of answering questions, and also ensures that answers are archived in case they're of use to others in the future.
